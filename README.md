Extra Muros 2022 â€“ Venedig

## About
This AR App has two main components/scenes. The first scene allows you to place a [concept building](https://mimo-hsd.de/project/concept/) in real scale and small scale in AR. The second scene demonstrates the energyflow of household devices, also within AR.

## Getting Started
This App is build and tested for Windows platforms.

### Setup development environment
The project is developed with Unity, using the [SimpleFileBrowser](https://github.com/yasirkula/UnitySimpleFileBrowser) Asset by [yasirkula](https://github.com/yasirkula). Based on the preferred platform the appropriate Build Support is needed. The Build Support can be found through Unity Hub under the Installs panel ("*Installs > Unity Version > Add Modules*").

## How to build the project

2. Under "Scene In Build" the following scene should be added: "MainScene"
3. Switch the build target to Windows
4. Press "Build and Run"

## Usage
